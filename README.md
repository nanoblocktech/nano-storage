# nano-storage
A tiny javascript storage using indexeddb engine to store data in browser.

This project is created because we have been using `Dexie` which is 81kb size, and in some projects, we only required a few functions from `Dexie`.
So with `NanoStorage` which is only 3kb we can use it whenever we are working on a small project that requires basic indexeddb usage.
